# Account and Data Deletion – Anotepad

Effective date: 2026-01-30

Anotepad does not create or store user accounts on developer servers. The only account used is your Google account for optional Google Drive sync.

## How to delete your data

### 1) Remove Anotepad files from Google Drive
If you enabled Drive sync, your notes are stored in your own Google Drive:
- Open Google Drive in a browser.
- Find the app folder (default name: **Anotepad**).
- Delete the folder and its contents.

### 2) Revoke Anotepad’s access to your Google account
To remove the app’s access token:
- Open **myaccount.google.com** → **Security** → **Third‑party access**.
- Find **Anotepad** and click **Remove access**.

## What data is deleted
- All synced notes and filenames stored in your Google Drive.

## What data is kept
- No data is stored by the developer.
- Local notes remain on your device until you delete them yourself.

## Retention
- No retention on developer servers (none exist).
